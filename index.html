                        What is the correct way to cook rice?

                        1. Rinse the rice<br>
                        2. Use the correct ration of water to rice. For one cup of rice add two parts water.<br>
                        3. Bring water to a boil, once the water is boiling add a pinch of salt.<br>
                        4. Add rice and reduce the heat to a simmer, make sure to cover with a right fitting lid.<br>
                        5. Do no remove the lid! Allow the rice to cook for 18-20 mins without interruption.<br>
                        6. Turn off the heat and let the rice rest for an extra 10 mins.<br>
                        7. Fluff with a fork.

                        How can you tell what temperature a steak is by touch?

                        1. Raw: Feel the palm of your hand, just below your thumb. It’s a little soft and fleshy. This is what raw steak should feel like when you touch it.<br>
                        2. Rare: Now bring your thumb to your pointer finger, and touch that same part of your palm again. Did you notice how it’s slightly firmer? A rare steak should feel like this when you touch it.<br>
                        3. Med-rare: Touch your thumb to your middle finger. Notice how that section of your palm tenses up a little more? This is what a medium-­rare steak feels like.<br>
                        4. Medium: Move your thumb to your ring finger. Now the palm may feel slightly flexed. This level of firmness means your steak is cooked medium.<br>
                        5. Well-done: Now touch your thumb to your pinky. That section of your palm will be fairly firm. This is what a well-­done steak feels like.

                        What is the difference between baking powder and baking soda?
                        <ion-icon class = "add" name="add"></ion-icon>

                        <p>
                        Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, which requires an acid and a liquid to become activated and help baked goods rise.

                        Baking powder includes sodium bicarbonate, as well as an acid. It only needs a liquid to become activated.
